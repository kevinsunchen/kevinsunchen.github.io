this summer i had the opportunity to intern at [Cambridge Electronics, Inc.](http://www.gantechnology.com/){:target="blank"} as a software development/device modeling intern. CEI is a small power electronics startup based in Cambridge, MA that specializes in creating "3DGaN technology" -- gallium nitride electronics that utilize a 3D structure to achieve better performance. i can't really get into specifics since, as a remote intern, i was pretty far removed from the physics/electrical engineering nitty-gritty of it all; my role revolved around creating software that helps the team better design, test, and generally mess with the electronics.

overall, i think this internship was a pretty positive experience: i created a product that i think is pretty rad, learned a good amount on a diverse range of topics (mostly non-technical!), and was fortunate enough to stay safe and stable throughout it all by working from home. this post will serve as a sort of explanation/record/reflection of that experience; hopefully as i write this i can think about the growth and missteps i made this summer, and hopefully in the future i can come back to this post and reflect on the growth and missteps i've made from now til then.

but before i get into more detail below, a brief explanation of my project: basically, the tools and processes that CEI was using for creating/modifying device designs were fairly clunky, pretty tedious, and prone to error (which is not ideal for electronics since the process of sending something to a foundry, getting it on a silicon wafer, testing it, etc. is quite laborious and expensive, i'd imagine). my job was to create new tools to overcome those hurdles, and my solution was giddspy (Graphical Interface for Device Design with Gdspy).
