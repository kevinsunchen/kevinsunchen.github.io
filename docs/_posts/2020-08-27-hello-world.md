i guess this marks the beginning of this site. the first post on a site that took embarrassingly long to set up (mostly because I wanted my own choice of font), created 5 days before the start of a virtual fall term.

i have yet to figure out what aesthetic to use for this site -- i have yet to figure out anything about this site, really. longform writing (in the vein of narrative, creative nonfiction, blog posts, etc) has always been difficult for me. i think part of it is because i am perpetually oscillating between "no thoughts head empty" and "idea machine go brrrrrr but too fast to capture everything" so i am left with a bunch of haphazard content ideas that i all want to include. but also part of me screams when the organization of the piece does not feel exactly right. so this leads to the unfortunate feeling of ~paralysis~

that aside, in the (semi-confessional? pseudo-reflective? talking-to-myself?) spirit of this post it's probably fitting to include a snapshot of my life at/around the moment:

* finished summer internship at Cambridge Electronics a week ago
* finished Google's foobar challenge two days ago
* planning and figuring things out for the MIT Fall Career Fair Series
* trying to revamp my resume and related online presences (cough this site, cough cough LinkedIn)
* nervous about the aforementioned fall term in 5 days

maybe (hopefully) some of those topics will become get their own posts. we shall see
